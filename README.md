# Event Management System

A very basic Java Student Society managing application based on my previous experience at Ba≈ükent Computer Society. As I've done for my task in my class "Laboratory of programming: applications in basic programming environments" 

## Specifications

Basically, there are 3 main Classes: Member, Responsible and Event. While members can reach only certain properties, responsible ones have a wider variety of operations.
